# Power-BI-Logistics-Operations-Dashboard
📦 Logistics Operations & Weather Monitoring Dashboards — Power BI
This project features two interactive Power BI dashboards built to analyze logistics performance and environmental conditions across a transportation network. I prepared the dataset using Power Query and developed custom DAX measures to calculate KPIs, model trends, and support dynamic filtering.

Highlights:

End‑to‑end data preparation: cleaning, merging, and modeling using Power Query

Custom DAX measures for shipment KPIs, fleet utilization, delay analysis, and environmental metrics

Shipment performance insights: on‑time delivery, delay reasons, monthly status trends

Fleet utilization breakdown across 10+ trucks

Weather monitoring dashboard with weekly temperature/humidity trends and operational KPIs

Designed for operational visibility, bottleneck detection, and data‑driven decision‑making

This project demonstrates my ability to blend data engineering, analytics, and visual storytelling to support logistics operations.
